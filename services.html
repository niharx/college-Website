                        <p>The Department of Civil Engineering of National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra (Formerly Regional Engineering College, Haryana) started functioning from the year 1963, when the first batch of students were admitted to the five year B Sc. Engineering Degree Course. In 1966, M Sc. Engineering Degree Courses in the specializations of Structural Engineering and Constructional Techniques; and Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering were started. The first registration for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Civil Engineering was done in 1967. The Institute switched over to four year B Tech Degree Programme from 1985. The M Sc Engineering programs were also renamed as M Tech programs. In 1989, M Tech Degree Course in Water Resources Engineering was started. Three Year Special Degree Course, “Bachelor of Engineering” for In-Service field engineers holding Diploma in Engineering was introduced from the Session 1982-83. The course was fully funded by Govt. of Haryana. The Govt. of Haryana has discontinued this course w.e.f 2001-02. Master of Technology in the specializations, Transportation Engineering and Environmental Engineering were started from year 2005.</p>

                        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
                        <p>The department started offering B.Tech. Programme in Computer Engineering in 1987 with initial intake of 30 students and subsequently raised to 92. Department also started B.Tech programme in Information Technology (IT) in 2006 with present intake of 92 students. The department is proud to have a record of almost 100% placement for last 10 years. The department also offers two M.Tech. programs, one in Computer Engineering and other in Cyber Security. Department started Ph.D. program in 2002. So far 20 Ph.D.s have been awarded and 39 PhDs are in progress. Currently there are five sponsored projects undergoing in the department.
